# heartburn
The emulator and tools for running [CARDIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARDboard_Illustrative_Aid_to_Computation) programs developed in Rust with [cargo cardiac](https://lab.strangequery.com/rust-cardiac/) or hand-assembled with [Cardigan](https://lab.strangequery.com/cardigan) or other tools.

## Running a program with `burn`
Heartburn (`burn` at the command line) is the execution engine, playing the
same role as `java` or the .NET CLR.
```
burn countdown.cqb    # runs it in the fast emulator
```

`burn` runs CARDIAC at about a billion instructions per second on a single core of a Mac Studio (Apple M5
Ultra).

heartburn comes with a few other useful tools for assembling, debugging and profiling programs running on `burn`.

## Installation
If you write your programs in Rust, you don't need anything from here. Install the [Rust compiler](https://lab.strangequery.com/rust-cardiac/) by running:

    cargo install cargo-cardiac

It runs, debugs and assembles programs with this code as `cargo cardiac run`, `cargo cardiac debug` and
`cargo cardiac asm`.

If you don't use Rust and just want `burn`, `carc` and `ekg`, install them with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    brew install strangequery/tap/heartburn

or download the archive for your platform from the [releases](https://github.com/StrangeQuery/heartburn/releases)
and put its folder on your PATH.

To build from the source code instead:

    git clone https://github.com/StrangeQuery/heartburn
    cd heartburn
    cargo build --release --features tools --bins

The commands end up in `target/release/`.


## What's in this package

| | | resembles |
|---|---|---|
| [`burn`](#heartburn) | the runtime: runs decks in a fast interpreter | `java`, `dotnet` |
| [`ekg`](#ekg) | the debugger and profiler | `gdb`, `perf` |
| [`carc`](#carc) | the assembler: turns six-column source code (`NAME.cq`) into decks (`NAME.cqb`) | `gcc` |

All of the commands follow the GNU conventions. They have `--help` and `--version`, short and long options, and
`--` to mark the end of the options. A file named `-` means standard input. Errors look like `PROG: message`, or
`FILE:LINE:COLUMN: error: message` when they point at a line. The exit status is 0 for success, 1 for failure and
2 for a mistake on the command line.


## Heartburn

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeQuery/heartburn/HEAD/assets/burn.png" alt="burn's mark: a rusty sawblade with CARDIAC's instruction clock cut through it" width="160">

Heartburn (`burn`) is the emulator that runs CARDIAC-compiled .cqb files:

    # run a deck
    burn countdown.cqb

    # give input cards after the deck (the -- is optional)
    burn add.cqb -- 123 456

    # or on standard input, where each card is read
    # when an INP asks for it
    echo 123 456 | burn add.cqb

    # read the deck itself from standard input
    carc - < add.cq | burn -

    # measure how fast this machine runs CARDIAC
    burn bench

**Decks.** A deck is plain text typically in a .cqb file with one card per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

`burn` has no
automatic loader, so a deck has to load itself, the way
[Brian Stuart's page](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html) describes. `carc` creates that bootstrap code automatically.

**Output.** Every value the program outputs is printed as a number on its own line. How the program stopped, and
after how many instructions, goes to standard error. If a program's output values are characters (65 for A, 10
for a new line), pipe the output through perl:

    burn hello.cqb | perl -CO -ne 'print chr if $_ >= 0'

**Overlays.** `burn` supports overlays as documented at [Strange Query](https://lab.strangequery.com/cardiac/overlays/). A program too big for memory comes as `NAME.cqb`, `NAME.2.cqb`, and so on. When a
deck is done, it halts with the program counter on the number of the deck to load next (HRS n), or on 00 when the
whole program is finished. `burn` then does what a person running the machine would do: it puts that deck in the
reader and starts the loader at 00. The decks can be loaded in any order, as often as the program asks. [Cardigan](https://lab.strangequery.com/cardigan/) is a useful tool for observing and debugging overlays.

**Why a compiled program panicked.** A compiler can write a panic map beside a deck, as a .pdb sits beside an .exe:
`cargo cardiac build` writes `NAME.map` with `NAME.cqb`. On CARDIAC a panic is just the value -999 and a halt. With
the map beside the deck, `burn` also says why on standard error, as Rust does, and exits 101 as `cargo run` does:

    $ burn days.cqb -- 13
    -999
         halted after 103 instructions
    burn: days.cqb: panicked in main: index out of bounds

Without a map, nothing changes, and `burn` runs at full speed: it only keeps track of where a run ended when there
is a map to read.

| | |
|---|---|
| `--limit=N` | stop a program after N instructions (the default is a billion) |
| `-h`, `--help` | display help and exit |
| `--version` | output version information and exit |

Options go before the deck. Everything after the deck is input, including anything that starts with a minus sign.
The exit status is 0 if the program halted or ran out of input cards. It is 1 if the deck can't be read, or if the
program never stops (a run stops after a billion instructions, or after `--limit`). It is 2 if there is a mistake
on the command line. It is 101 if the panic map says the program panicked (134 for a violated unsafe
precondition, as Rust aborts on one).

## ekg

`ekg` is the debugger and the profiler. You give it either a listing or a deck, followed by the program's input.
`ekg` tells which one it has from what is inside the file. A listing is assembled the way `carc` assembles it, and
its labels and comments are kept for display. A deck is loaded through its own loader, the way `burn` loads it, and
then disassembled.

    ekg countdown.cq             # debug at the (ekg) prompt
    ekg --batch mul.cq -x 'break 17' -x run -x 'p p' -- 6 7
    ekg --profile mul.cq -- 6 7  # run to the end and report where the instructions went

**Debugging.** The commands are the same as gdb's wherever gdb has an equivalent. A PLACE is a cell (00 to 99), a
label, or `label+N`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `run`, `r` | start the program again from the beginning, with its input, and continue |
| `continue`, `c` | run until a breakpoint, a watch, a halt, or an INP with no card to read |
| `step`, `s` [N] | run one instruction, or N of them |
| `next`, `n` [N] | like `step`, but when a JMP calls a routine, run the whole routine and stop at the cell after the JMP. (A JMP counts as a call when the code it jumps to reads cell 99, the way back, before it reaches another JMP.) |
| `break`, `b` PLACE | stop before the instruction in PLACE runs |
| `watch` PLACE | stop after an instruction writes to PLACE |
| `delete`, `d` [PLACE] | remove the breakpoint and the watch on PLACE, or all of them if no PLACE is given |
| `info break`, `i b` | list the breakpoints and watches |
| `info registers`, `i r` | show the program counter, the accumulator, how many instructions have run, and the cards in the reader |
| `print`, `p` PLACE | show a cell's value, and what it means as an instruction (`p acc` and `p pc` also work) |
| `x` PLACE [N] | show the values of N cells starting at PLACE (10 if N isn't given) |
| `list`, `l` [PLACE] | show the listing around the program counter (or around PLACE), with the program counter marked `>` and breakpoints marked `b` |
| `set` PLACE VALUE | write a value into a cell (`set acc VALUE` and `set pc PLACE` also work) |
| `input` CARDS... | add cards to the reader, after the ones already in it |
| `help`, `h` | list the commands |
| `quit`, `q` | leave |

Pressing Enter on an empty line repeats the last `step`, `next` or `continue`. Whenever `ekg` stops, it shows the
next instruction the way the listing has it. If the program has rewritten that cell, the instruction is decoded
again from the new value. Each value the program outputs is printed as soon as it is output, on a line starting
with `out:`. If an INP finds no card left, `ekg` stops and waits for you to give it more with `input`.

**Profiling.** `--profile` runs the program to the end and prints a report on standard output, while the program's
own output goes to standard error. The report shows how many instructions ran, the hottest cells, every cell of the
listing with how often it ran, the cells the program wrote to (and which of those it also ran, meaning code it
rewrites), and the listed instructions that never ran. If you give no input, the program reads its cards from
standard input, as it would in `burn`. To see every instruction, `ekg` drives the machine one instruction at a time.
It profiles about 270 million instructions per second, a quarter of `burn`'s speed, and `burn` doesn't pay anything
for it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `-x`, `--eval-command=COMMAND` | carry out COMMAND (you can give any number of them, and they run in order) |
| `--batch` | carry out the `-x` commands, then exit without reading standard input |
| `-q`, `--quiet`, `--silent` | skip the introduction |
| `--profile` | profile instead of debugging |
| `--limit=N` | stop a run after N instructions (the default is 1,000,000,000) |
| `--start-at=NN` | start a listing at cell NN (by default, where `carc` would start it) |
| `--help` | display help and exit |
| `--version` | output version information and exit |

The exit status is 0 on success. It is 1 if something failed: the listing has errors, a `-x` command failed in
`--batch` mode, or a profile run was stopped by the limit. It is 2 if there is a mistake on the command line.

## How fast

`burn bench` runs three countdown loops nested inside each other, 626.5 million instructions in all, on one core.
Here is the same program on every CARDIAC emulator we could build and run on an Apple M5 Ultra (October 2026):

| emulator                          | language   | million instructions a second | per instruction |
|-----------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **HEARTBURN**                     | Rust       | **1,070**                     | **0.94 ns**     |
| InPermutation/CARDIAC `cem.c`     | C (`-O2`)  | 438                           | 2.3 ns          |
| fzaca/CardiacVisualizer           | Rust       | 110                           | 9.1 ns          |
| weibell/python-cardiac-emu        | Python 3.9 | 2.4                           | 417 ns          |
| rzinkstok/cardiac                 | Python 3.9 | 1.25                          | 800 ns          |

These figures are per core. A CARDIAC program runs one instruction after another, so a single run uses a single
core, but separate runs can go side by side on as many cores as the machine has.

How it gets this fast, so far:

- Each cell's instruction is decoded once and kept next to its value. It is decoded again only when the cell is
  written, which matters because CARDIAC programs rewrite their own code all the time to index arrays. The decoding
  comes from a 4 KB table that holds the decoding of every possible word.
- The accumulator wraps around with a comparison rather than a division.
- JMP writes cell 99 already decoded.
- A 101st decoded cell sends the program counter back round to 00, so no step has to check for it.
- Tracing, which `burn` uses to say where a run stopped, is switched on or off when the program is compiled, so it
  costs nothing when it is off.
- The main loop never allocates memory.

What comes next is fewer processor cycles per step, and running the idioms CARDIAC code is made of as single
operations. For example, an indexed load is four instructions of self-modifying code. There is no JIT compiler.
HEARTBURN is an interpreter, made as fast as an interpreter can be.

## As a library

All of the commands are built on one Rust crate, [heartburn](https://crates.io/crates/heartburn): the machine
(`cardiac`), the assembler that `carc` and Cardigan use (`assemble`), decks (`tape`), listings in the manual's other
formats (`listing`), and panic maps (`panics`). Add it to a program of your own with `cargo add heartburn`.

```rust
use heartburn::listing::{self, Listing};
use heartburn::tape::Tape;

// the manual's Program No. 1: read two cards, output their sum
let read = listing::parse("17 034\n18 035\n19 134\n20 235\n21 636\n22 536\n23 900\n")?;
let Listing::Memory(cells) = read.listing else { return Err("a deck, not a memory listing".into()) };
let tape = Tape::one(listing::deck(17, &cells)?);
let (outputs, why, steps) = tape.run(&[2, 3], 1_000)?;   // [5], Halt, 34 instructions
```

`examples/add.rs` is this same code, ready to run with `cargo run --example add`. `cardiac::run` runs a deck
directly, and `cardiac::Machine` is the machine a debugger holds onto: you can step it, run it to a breakpoint, and
read and write its memory. Breakpoints cost nothing per instruction, and a plain run doesn't pay for any of it.


## carc

`carc` is the assembler. It turns a listing into a deck.

    carc countdown.cq                           # writes countdown.cqb next to it
    carc --start-at=10 -o out.cqb countdown.cq  # options can go before or after the file
    carc - < countdown.cq | burn -              # read the listing from standard input, write the deck to standard output

**Listings.** A listing has one cell per line. The columns are either Brian Stuart's six, `ADDRESS CONTENTS LABEL
OPCODE OPERAND COMMENT`, or the manual's three, `ADDRESS CONTENTS COMMENT`. You can leave the contents out, and
`carc` works them out from the opcode and the operand. The operand can be a number, a `label`, or `label+N`.
`DATA` (or `DAT`) puts a plain number in a cell. Lines that aren't cells, such as titles, prose, and comments
starting with `;` or `#`, are skipped.

**Where the program starts.** The deck starts the program at the cell given by `--start-at`. Without it, `carc`
looks in the listing: first for a `Start at NN.` line, then for a line labelled `start`, and otherwise it uses the
first instruction.

**Errors and warnings** are reported the way a compiler reports them. While there are errors, no deck is written.
If a cell's contents disagree with its opcode and operand, that is only a warning, and the contents are what get
loaded.

| | |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output=FILE` | write the deck to FILE (`-` means standard output). By default it goes to `NAME.cqb` next to `NAME.cq`, or to standard output if the listing came from standard input. |
| `--start-at=NN` | start the program at cell NN |
| `-h`, `--help` | display help and exit |
| `--version` | output version information and exit |

The exit status is 0 if the deck was written. It is 1 if the listing has errors or a file can't be read or
written, and 2 if there is a mistake on the command line.

## Quickstart

heartburn uses the six-column assembly language format described on
[Brian Stuart's page](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html):

* **Address**: the cell, from 00 to 99. Cell 00 always holds 001, the loader uses cells 01 and 02 while it reads
  the deck in, and every JMP writes to cell 99.
* **Contents**: a number from -999 to 999. You can leave it out, and the assembler will work it out from the
  opcode and the operand.
* **Label**: an optional name for the cell, used mostly for jumps and data.
* **Opcode**: the name of the instruction. Strictly speaking it is redundant, because the first digit of the
  contents says the same thing.
* **Operand**: a cell, a label, or `label+N`.
* **Comment**: anything on the rest of the line.

Here is a program in this format that counts down from 5. Save it as `countdown.cq`:

    ; Countdown: prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 and stops.
    ; Start at 10.
    ; Address Contents Label Opcode Operand Comment
    10   530  start  OUT  n      print n, take one off, and stop once it goes below zero
    11   130         CLA  n
    12   700         SUB  00     00 holds 001: whenever you need a 1, it is there
    13   316         TAC  done
    14   630         STO  n
    15   810         JMP  start
    16   900  done   HRS  00
    30   005  n      DATA 5      counts down from here

(The file names don't really matter. `.cq` and `.cqb` are just the conventions these tools use, and both are plain
text that any tool can create or change.)

**Assemble it.** `carc` writes `countdown.cqb` next to the listing:

    $ carc countdown.cq
    $ cat countdown.cqb
    # countdown.cqb: countdown.cq on cards, for the loader; it starts at 10
    # CARDIAC cards, one per line, read from the top. The program's input goes after them.
    002
    800
    010
    530
    ...
    030
    005
    002
    810

The first two cards, `002` and `800`, start the bootstrap loader. After them come pairs of cards, an address and
its contents, which fill in the cells. The deck ends with a jump to the start of the program, which is cell 10 here.
`carc` writes all of this for you.

**Run it.**

    $ burn countdown.cqb
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    0
         halted after 65 instructions

`burn` reads the program's input from standard input and prints its output on standard output. The message about
how the program stopped goes to standard error, so the output can be piped somewhere else cleanly. The count
includes the 30 instructions the loader ran to read the deck in. `ekg`, described above, loads a listing through the
same loader, so a program runs in `ekg` exactly as it does in `burn`.

**Make a mistake.** Misspell the label in cell 13, and get cell 11's contents wrong:

    $ carc oops.cq
    oops.cq:5:6: warning: contents +131, but CLA n is +130: loading the contents
    oops.cq:7:23: error: unknown label dun
    carc: oops.cq: not assembled: no deck written

**Debug it.** Stop at `start`, look at `n`, watch it change, then carry on. You can type the commands at the
`(ekg)` prompt, or give them on the command line with `-x`:

    $ ekg --batch countdown.cq -x 'break start' -x run -x 'p n' -x 'watch n' -x continue \
          -x continue -x 'info registers' -x delete -x continue
    breakpoint at 10 (start)
    breakpoint, cell 10
    10   530  start    OUT  n        ; print n, take one off, and stop once it goes below zero
    30 (n) = 005
    watching 30 (n)
    out: 5
    watch, cell 30 (n): 005 -> 004, written by cell 14
    15   810           JMP  start
    breakpoint, cell 10
    10   530  start    OUT  n        ; print n, take one off, and stop once it goes below zero
    pc 10  acc +0004  steps 36  reader []
    out: 4
    out: 3
    out: 2
    out: 1
    out: 0
    halted: HRS in cell 16, after 65 instructions

**Profile it.**

    $ ekg --profile countdown.cq 2>/dev/null
    countdown.cq: halted after 35 instructions (and 30 loading the deck), in 0.000 s (1.3 million a second)

    Hottest cells:

      99           written          5  the way back JMP leaves

    Listed instructions never run:
      none

You can also do all of this in a browser with [Cardigan](https://lab.strangequery.com/cardigan/). It uses the same
assembler and the same machine, and it draws the machine as it runs.
